# CS 5/7320 Artificial Intelligence

Assignments and examples for the course in CS 5/7320 Artificial Intelligence in the 
[Computer Science Department at SMU](https://www.smu.edu/Lyle/Academics/Departments/CS) by [Michael Hahsler](https://michael.hahsler.net/) 

You can fork this repository to work on your solutions locally. You can 
* use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and the [jupyter/datascience-notebook](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/datascience-notebook) image (run `docker run -p 8888:8888 jupyter/datascience-notebook`), or 
* install Python, Jupyter and the needed packages, or
* use a service like the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mhahsler/CS7320-AI/blob/master/) environment (there are some limitations and you will have to copy some needed files to Google Drive). 

The easiest way is to use the Docker image which already contains almost everything we need.

Submit a pdf of the compiled notebook (either export the notebook as pdf or print to pdf). The notebook needs to be a complete project report with documentation (including your design choices), code and results (e.g., tables with simulation results) with a short discussion of what they mean. Use the provided notebook cells and insert additional code and markdown cells as needed.
